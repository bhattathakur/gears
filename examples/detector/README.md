## Detector construction
### Geometry
[GEARS][] accepts two types of detector geometry descriptions in pure ASCII format as input:
- [Geant4][] [text geometry description][tg] (recommended)
- [GDML][] (provided for data analysis and visualization in other tools)
Their difference is similar to that between [markdown][md] and [HTML][]. The simpler [text geometry description][tg] provided by [Geant4][] is recommended to be used as [GEARS][]'s input given its simplicity and readability. For example, an experimental hall filled with air and of a dimension of 10 x 10 x 10 meters can be easily implemented using the following line:

~~~
:volume hall BOX 5*m 5*m 5*m G4_AIR
~~~

For more examples, please check `*.tg` files in the [examples/](https://github.com/jintonic/gears/blob/master/examples/) directory, such as [examples/Rutherford/hall.tg](https://github.com/jintonic/gears/blob/master/examples/Rutherford/hall.tg). The suffix of *.tg* indicates that they are [text geometry][tg] description files. A [Geant4][] macro command `/geometry/source` is added to load geometry files:

~~~
/geometry/source examples/Rutherford/foil.tg
~~~

Alternatively,

~~~
/geometry/source file.gdml
~~~

The command must be used before [/run/initialize][run], otherwise [GEARS][] will construct a simple experimental hall automatically to prevent crashing.

[GEARS][] provides the following command to export constructed detector geometry to a [GDML][] file:

~~~
/geometry/export output.gdml
~~~

This can only be used after the macro command [/run/initialize][run], which constructs the detector geometry before exporting. While the simpler [text geometry description][tg] can only be understood by [Geant4][], [GDML][] can be understood by many other tools. For example, [ROOT][] provides functions to read and visualize [GDML][] geometries. On the other hand, it is not that easy to write a valid [GDML][] file manually. This functionality is provided to enable the following usage:

~~~
# describe the detector using simple text geometry description
/geometry/source input.tg
# construct the detector
/run/intialize
# export detector geometry as GDML for analysis/visualization in other tools
/geometry/export output.gdml
~~~

#### Sensitive detector

Sensitive detectors are specified by simply add "(S)" at the end of their volume names. The copy numbers of their volumes must be continuous integers starting from 0.

### Material

The [NIST][] material table provided by [Geant4][] contains all elements (C, H, O, for example) and a lot of commonly used materials (start with "G4_"). One can run /material/nist/[listMaterials][] at any [Geant4][] state to print the list locally. These materials can be used directly in a [text geometry description][tg], for example

~~~
// use Geant4 elements, C and H to define TPB
:MIXT_BY_NATOMS TPB 1.079 2 C 28 H 22
// use NIST material G4_AIR to define vacuum
:mixt vacuum 1e-9 1 G4_AIR 1
~~~

### Optical properties of a material or a surface

There is no tag to define the optical properties of a material or a surface in the default [Geant4][] [text geometry description][tg]. The following two tags are added in [GEARS][] to enable definition of optical materials and surfaces using [Geant4][] [text geometry description][tg] syntax:

#### Define optical properties of a material

~~~
//:prop <material>
//  <wavelength-independent_property> <value>
:prop pureCsIat77K
  SCINTILLATIONYIELD 100./keV
  RESOLUTIONSCALE 2.
  FASTTIMECONSTANT 1.*ns
  SLOWTIMECONSTANT 1.*us
  YIELDRATIO 0.8

//:prop <material> photon_energies <int(array size)> <energy array>
//  <wavelength-dependent_property> <property values>
:prop pureCsIat77K
  photon_energies 2 2.034*eV, 3.025*eV, 4.136*eV
  RINDEX 1.34, 1.35, 1.36
  ABSLENGTH 1.0*meter, 1.1*meter, 1.2*meter
~~~

#### Define optical properties of a surface

First of all, there is no need to define a *surface* for polished interfaces between two media. As long as the two media have an index of refraction stored in their respective G4MaterialPropertiesTable, the [G4OpBoundaryProcess][]::[PostStepDoIt][] will handle the refraction and reflection correctly.

One can use the following syntax to define a [G4LogicalBorderSurface][] in case that there is a real need to specify the optical properties of the interface:

~~~
//:surf v12v2 v1:copyNo1 v2:copyNo2
:surf CsI2Teflon CsI:1 Teflon:1
  type dielectric_dielectric
  model unified
  finish ground
  sigma_alpha 0.1
  property photon_energies 2 2.5*eV 5.0*eV
    REFLECTIVITY 0.9 0.9
//property must be the last setting due to the current coding method
~~~

Note that physics volumes from the same logical volume created by the text geometry processor share the same name as their logical volume. Since [G4LogicalBorderSurface][] requires pointers to the two physical volumes beside, a unique copy number has to be attached to the volume name to uniquely identify the physics volume.
